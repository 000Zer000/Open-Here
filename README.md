# Open Here

A pack of Windows registry files (`.reg`) which every developer and sysadmin needs. 

I always used these registry files and now wanted to share it.

# Features

1. Adds `Open Command Prompt Here` option in the menu opened with Right click.

2. Adds `Open Poweshell Here` option in the menu opened with Right click.

3. Adds `Open PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment Here` option in the menu opened with Right click.

4. Or a shorter named version of feature 3 is available.

# Installation

Simply clone this repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TheOddZer0/Open-Here
```

You can run `Install.bat` as **Administrator** to let it import the registries for your or **if you are DIY person 
then you can double click each registry file**:

**Use `Cmd.reg` for `Open Command Prompt Here`.**

**Use `Poweshell.reg` for `Open Powershell Here`.**

**Use `Powershell_ISE.reg` for `Open PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment Here`.**

(Replaces `Powershell_ISE.reg` keys) **Use `Powershell_ISE_Short.reg` for `Open PowerShell ISE Here`.**
